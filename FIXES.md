# Tech Chess - Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Chess Engine Error**
- **Problem**: The HTML was not loading the chess engine properly. The bot expected a custom `ChessEngine` class but the UI was using the `Chess.js` library from CDN.
- **Solution**: Removed the unused custom `ChessEngine` class and rewrote the `MartinaBot` to work with the standard `Chess.js` library API.

### 2. **Duplicate and Confusing Files**
- **Problem**: There were duplicate files causing confusion:
  - `js/martina-bot.js` (not loaded, duplicate)
  - `js/bots/martina.js` (loaded, same content)
  - `js/chess-engine.js` (not loaded, unused custom engine)
- **Solution**: Deleted duplicate files. Now only `js/bots/martina.js` exists.

### 3. **Bot Not Actually Playing**
- **Problem**: The `makeBotMove()` method in `ui.js` was just making random moves instead of using the bot's AI.
- **Solution**: Updated the method to call `bot.calculateMove()` to use the actual AI.

### 4. **Infinite Recursion Bug**
- **Problem**: The bot's `evaluatePosition()` method called itself on line 319, causing a stack overflow.
- **Solution**: Fixed the evaluation method to call proper sub-methods instead of recursing infinitely.

### 5. **Poor Bot Performance**
- **Problem**: Bot was making random moves (not using AI) and had no proper evaluation.
- **Solution**: Implemented Sebastian Lague's AI methods:
  - Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
  - Transposition table for performance
  - Piece-square tables for position evaluation
  - Move ordering for better pruning
  - Material + mobility + king safety evaluation
  - Opening book for common openings

## File Structure (Cleaned Up)

```
/js
  /bots
    martina.js          ← Bot AI (uses Chess.js library)
  chess-engine.js       ← DELETED (was unused)
  main.js              ← Entry point
  martina-bot.js       ← DELETED (was duplicate)
  ui.js                ← UI management (now calls bot AI)
  utils.js             ← Utility functions
```

## Testing

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Click "Start Game"
3. Make a move as white
4. The bot should now "think" for a moment and make an intelligent move
5. Check browser console for any errors (should be none)

## What Changed in the Bot

- Uses Chess.js library methods: `chess.moves()`, `chess.move()`, `chess.undo()`, `chess.board()`, etc.
- Implements minimax with alpha-beta pruning (depth 1-3 depending on difficulty)
- Uses transposition tables to avoid re-evaluating same positions
- Evaluates positions based on:
  - Material value
  - Piece positioning (piece-square tables)
  - Mobility (number of legal moves)
  - King safety
- Orders moves for better alpha-beta pruning (captures and checks first)

## Performance

- **Too Easy**: Depth 1 (instant, very weak)
- **Just for Fun**: Depth 2 (fast, moderate strength)
- **Standard**: Depth 3 (thinks 1-2 seconds, stronger)

The bot should now play reasonable chess moves instead of random moves!
