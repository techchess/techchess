# Bug Fix v2 - Board State Corruption

## The Problem
The bot was **corrupting the game board state** during its thinking process, causing random/crazy positions to appear after the bot moved.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. **Board State Modification During Search**
The bot's minimax algorithm was directly modifying the chess engine object during its search tree exploration. Even though it called `undo()` after each move, there were cases where the state wasn't properly restored.

### 2. **Move Ordering Corruption**
The `orderMoves()` function was making and undoing moves on the board just to check if they gave check, which could corrupt the state.

### 3. **Evaluation Function Corruption**
The `evaluate()` function was manipulating the FEN string to switch turns and count opponent moves, which could corrupt the board state.

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ 1. Added State Verification
- Save FEN position before any operations
- Verify FEN matches after operations
- Restore from saved FEN if corruption detected
- Added try-catch blocks with state restoration

### ✅ 2. Fixed Move Ordering
- Removed board modifications from `orderMoves()`
- Now uses simple heuristics without touching the board:
  - MVV-LVA (Most Valuable Victim - Least Valuable Attacker) for captures
  - Center control bonus
  - No more making/undoing moves to check for checks

### ✅ 3. Fixed Evaluation Function
- Removed the turn-switching code that modified board state
- Simplified mobility evaluation to just count current player's moves
- No more FEN string manipulation

### ✅ 4. Added Comprehensive Error Checking
- Every move/undo pair now verified with FEN comparison
- Error messages logged to console if corruption detected
- Automatic restoration of correct position if corruption occurs
- Fallback to random move if bot completely fails

### ✅ 5. Added Debug Logging
- UI now logs position before and after bot thinks
- Logs the move the bot chooses
- Logs if the bot corrupts the board state
- Helps identify exactly when/where issues occur

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open browser console** (press F12)
2. **Refresh the page**: http://localhost:8000
3. **Start a new game**
4. **Make a move as White**
5. **Watch the console** for debug messages:
   - "Position before bot thinks: ..." (should be valid FEN)
   - "Position after bot thinks: ..." (should match the before FEN)
   - "Bot chose move: ..." (should show the bot's chosen move)
   - "Move executed: ..." (should show the executed move)

## What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs:
- Position FEN before and after thinking are **identical**
- Bot makes a legal chess move
- No error messages in console
- Board updates correctly with bot's move

### ❌ Bad Signs (report these):
- "BOT CORRUPTED THE BOARD STATE!" in console
- Position FEN before/after are different
- "Undo failed!" messages
- "Minimax corrupted state!" messages
- Pieces appear in impossible positions

## If Issues Persist

Check the console for specific error messages and share them. The debug logging will now show exactly where the corruption happens.
